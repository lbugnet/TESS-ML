This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


---------------------------------------- START --------------------------------------------------------------

Import needed packages, define data PATH.

```{r}
require(caret)
require(ggplot2)
require(randomForest)

PATH <- "/Users/lbugnet/DATA/TABLES/TESS_SIMU/"
```


Define train and test samples from TESS simulated data. Choice: clean ("CL") or noisy ("NO") data depending on the "TYPE_DATA" parameter.

```{r}
TYPE_DATA <- readline(prompt="Enter CL or NO: ")

train = read.table(paste(PATH , "example_for_ml_7_",TYPE_DATA, "A3_2.txt", sep="")) 
train<- train[,-c(9)] #remove columns you don't need

test=read.table(paste(PATH, "example_for_ml_7_",TYPE_DATA,"A3_1.txt", sep=""))
test<- test[,-c(9)] #remove columns you don't need
```

Define columns names:  
Fp07: FliPer calculated from 0.7 $\mu$Hz  
Fp10: FliPer calculated from 10 $\mu$Hz  
Fp30: FliPer calculated from 30 $\mu$Hz  
teff: effective temperatures from TESS simulated data  
diff: Fp30-Fp10  
diff2: Fp20-Fp07  
diff3: Fp10-Fp07  
Fp_med: FP07 - (FliPer calculated by the median of the PSD instead of the mean from 0.7 $\mu$Hz)  
Classe: input categories of TESS stars  


```{r}
colnames(train) <- c("Fp07", "teff","Fp10", "Fp30" ,"diff","diff2", "diff3", "Fp_med",  "Classe")
colnames(test) <- c("Fp07", "teff","Fp10", "Fp30" ,"diff","diff2","diff3", "Fp_med", "Classe")
```


  
Plot training set:

```{r}
ggplot(data=train,aes(x=log10(Fp07), y=teff, color= train$Classe, main=paste("train sample", TYPE_DATA))) + geom_point()
```


Training data preparation:
```{r}
#make formula
varNames <- names(train)

# Exclude ID or Response variable
varNames <- varNames[!varNames %in% c("Classe")]

# add + sign between exploratory variables
varNames1 <- paste(varNames, collapse = "+")

# Add response variable and convert to a formula object
rf.form <- as.formula(paste("Classe", varNames1, sep = " ~ "))

```

---------------------------------- Training ------------------------------------------------------------

Use RandomForest R alghorithm to train the model on the training set:
```{r}
RRandomForest_train <- randomForest( rf.form, data = train, ntree = 2000, mtry = sqrt(10), type = classification,  replace = FALSE, maxnodes = 60, nodesize = 5, importance = TRUE )
```


Performances:
```{r}
RRandomForest_train$importance #a matrix with nclass + 2 (for classification) or two (for regression) columns. For classification, the first nclass columns are the class-specific measures computed as mean descrease in accuracy. The nclass + 1st column is the mean descrease in accuracy over all classes. The last column is the mean decrease in Gini index.
```


Plot of error VS number of trees
```{r}
plot(RRandomForest_train)
legend("top", colnames(RRandomForest_train$err.rate),col=1:10,cex=0.8,fill=1:10)
```


OOB estimate error and Confusion matric for the training set:
```{r}
RRandomForest_train
```


PLots of accuracy and Gini index: Gives influences of parameters on the training
```{r}
varImpPlot(RRandomForest_train, type=1, pch=19, col=1, cex=.5, main="")#accuracy
varImpPlot(RRandomForest_train, type=2)#Gini
```


------------------------------------ Testing on Test Data ---------------------------------------------

```{r}
###testing
test$predicted <- predict(RRandomForest_train, test)
```


Confusion matrix: (estimated classes in columns, real classes in lines)
```{r}
conf <- confusionMatrix(data = test$predicted, reference = test$Classe)
print(conf)
```

-------------------------------------- Plot results: ---------------------------------------------------

Test sample predicted


```{r}
ggplot(data=test,aes(x=log10(Fp07), y=teff, color= test$predicted, main=paste("predicted classes", TYPE_DATA))) + geom_point()
```

Test sample real classes

```{r}
ggplot(data=test,aes(x=log10(Fp07), y=teff, color= test$Classe, main=paste("test real classes", TYPE_DATA))) + geom_point()
```
